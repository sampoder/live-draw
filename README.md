# üñç live-draw

![Demo](https://cloud-5nh13qcn7.vercel.app/0ezgif-4-53a58d00d32a.gif)

This is a live activity for events where attendees write basic code to draw shapes on a large screen.

The attendees enter a terminal-like interface where they write commands inspired by p5.js, these are then checked and sent to the webpage at `/live` using Socket.io which then runs them on the p5.js canvas.

Try the attendee view: https://draw-innov-week.sampoder.com
And the main screen view: https://draw-innov-week.sampoder.com/live

Enjoy!
